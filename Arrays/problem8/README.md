# 🔢 Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s

## 📘 Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` consisting only of **0s**, **1s**, and **2s**, sort the array **in-place** so that all 0s come first, followed by 1s, and then 2s.

---

## 🧠 Example

**Input:**  
`nums = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]`

**Output:**  
`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`

---

## ⚙️ Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- Each element in `nums` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`
- The sorting must be done **in-place** (without using extra space for sorting)
