# DSA Problem Solutions 📚

Welcome to my **DSA Problem Solutions** repository! This repo contains solutions to hundreds of **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** problems, organized by topic. Each problem includes a **problem statement**, **example input/output**, and a **coded solution** in C++ (or Python/Java where applicable).

This repo is a reflection of my **problem-solving journey on LeetCode** and other competitive programming platforms. It’s designed to help others learn patterns, techniques, and improve their DSA skills.
